### Module 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

#### 1.1 Introduction to Ethical Hacking
- **Ethical Hacking**: Practice of bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network.
- **Purpose**: To improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing.

#### 1.2 Key Terminologies
- **Threat**: Potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization.
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat.
- **Risk**: Potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
- **Attack**: An attempt to gain unauthorized access to system services, resources, or information.

#### 1.3 Types of Hackers
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who violate computer security for personal gain or to inflict damage.
- **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who work to protect systems and networks.
- **Grey Hat Hackers**: Individuals who may violate laws or ethical standards but without malicious intent.

#### 1.4 Phases of Ethical Hacking
1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering preliminary data or intelligence on the target.
   - **Active Reconnaissance**: Direct interaction with the target to gather information.
   - **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without direct interaction.
2. **Scanning**: Identifying network ranges, active machines, open ports, and services running on the target.
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the target system.
4. **Maintaining Access**: Ensuring continued access to the target system without detection.
5. **Covering Tracks**: Removing traces of the hacking activity to avoid detection.

#### 1.5 Ethical Hacking Standards and Laws
- **Standards**: Frameworks and guidelines for ethical hacking and information security (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST).
- **Laws**: Legal aspects governing the practice of hacking (e.g., Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, GDPR).

#### 1.6 Skills Required for Ethical Hackers
- **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in programming, networking, and systems administration.
- **Non-Technical Skills**: Problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication.

#### 1.7 Common Tools and Techniques
- **Footprinting Tools**: Nmap, Whois, Nslookup, Shodan.
- **Scanning Tools**: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto.
- **Exploitation Tools**: Metasploit, SQLmap, Burp Suite.

#### 1.8 Ethical Hacking Process
- **Planning**: Defining the scope and objectives of the ethical hacking engagement.
- **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target.
- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation**: Demonstrating the impact of vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Documenting findings and providing recommendations for remediation.
