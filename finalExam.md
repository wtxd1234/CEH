### Ethical Hacking Overview

**Definition:** Ethical hacking involves authorized and legal attempts to exploit computer systems to identify security vulnerabilities, providing the organization with insights to strengthen their defenses.

**Scope:**
- **Penetration Testing:** Conducting simulated attacks to discover security weaknesses.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Systematic examination to find vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
- **Security Audits:** Evaluating the effectiveness of security policies and controls.
- **Risk Management:** Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated efforts to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events.

### Five Steps of Ethical Hacking

1. **Footprinting and Reconnaissance**
   - **Purpose:** Gather preliminary data about the target system to plan the attack.
   - **Tools:** 
     - **Harvester:** Collects information like email addresses, subdomains, IPs, URLs, and employee names from various public sources.
     - **Maltego:** A tool for open-source intelligence and forensics, allowing the visualization of the gathered data.
   - **Output:** Detailed information about the target, including domain names, IP addresses, network infrastructure, and potentially exploitable entry points.

2. **Network Scanning**
   - **Purpose:** Identify live systems, open ports, and services running on those systems.
   - **Tools:**
     - **Nmap:** Network scanning tool to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
     - **Zenmap:** The GUI version of Nmap, which makes it easier to visualize the network and interpret results.
   - **Output:** A map of the network, including the devices connected, open ports, and running services which help in identifying potential points of entry.

3. **Enumeration**
   - **Purpose:** Extract detailed information about network resources and shared services.
   - **Tools:**
     - **nbtstat:** Used for displaying network protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
     - **SNMPwalk:** Collects information from network devices using the Simple Network Management Protocol.
   - **Output:** Lists of usernames, group names, shared resources, and other detailed network information that can be used to plan further attacks.

4. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - **Purpose:** Identify and classify vulnerabilities in the system without exploiting them.
   - **Tools:** 
     - **Nessus:** A comprehensive vulnerability scanning tool that assesses devices for known vulnerabilities.
     - **OpenVAS:** An open-source vulnerability scanner.
   - **Output:** A detailed report of the vulnerabilities found, including their severity, potential impacts, and remediation suggestions.

5. **Exploitation**
   - **Purpose:** Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems.
   - **Tools:** 
     - **Metasploit Framework:** A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
     - **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework):** A tool that focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers.
   - **Output:** Proof of concept that demonstrates the exploitability of vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access to systems or data.

### Types of Ethical Hacking

1. **White Hat Hacking:** Authorized hacking conducted to improve security.
   - **Purpose:** Identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
   - **Example:** A company hiring a cybersecurity firm to conduct a penetration test.

2. **Black Hat Hacking:** Unauthorized and illegal hacking with malicious intent.
   - **Purpose:** Gain unauthorized access, steal data, disrupt services.
   - **Example:** Hackers breaking into systems to steal credit card information.

3. **Grey Hat Hacking:** Unauthorized hacking without malicious intent, often to highlight security issues.
   - **Purpose:** Point out security flaws to prompt improvements.
   - **Example:** A hacker identifying a vulnerability in a companyâ€™s system and notifying them without prior permission.

**Comparison:**
- **White Hat:** Legal, ethical, and intended to protect systems.
- **Black Hat:** Illegal, unethical, and aimed at exploitation.
- **Grey Hat:** Often unauthorized but with no intent to harm, aiming to improve security.

### Penetration Testing

**Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities and determine how easily they can be exploited by real attackers.

**Types of Penetration Testing:**
- **Black Box Testing:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the target.
- **White Box Testing:** The tester has full knowledge of the target.
- **Grey Box Testing:** The tester has partial knowledge of the target.

**Output:** A comprehensive report detailing the vulnerabilities found, the methods used to exploit them, and recommendations for remediation.

### Types of Password Attacks

1. **Social Engineering**
   - **Definition:** Manipulating people into divulging confidential information.
   - **Example:** Phishing emails that trick users into providing their login credentials.
   - **Prevention:** Training employees to recognize phishing attempts, using multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2. **Brute Force Attack**
   - **Tools:** 
     - **John the Ripper:** A password cracking software tool.
     - **Hydra:** A fast and flexible network logon cracker.
   - **Method:** Trying all possible password combinations until the correct one is found.
   - **Prevention:** Using complex passwords, account lockout mechanisms, and rate limiting.

3. **Rainbow Table Attack**
   - **Definition:** Using precomputed tables of hash values to crack passwords.
   - **Prevention:** Salting passwords, using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

4. **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attack**
   - **Definition:** Intercepting and altering communication between two parties.
   - **Tools:**
     - **Ettercap:** A comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks on LAN.
   - **Prevention:** Using encrypted communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS), secure VPNs.

### Scenario Example

**Scenario:** An attacker floods a server with traffic, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Type:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

**How It Works:** 
- **Botnet:** A network of compromised computers (bots) controlled by the attacker sends massive amounts of traffic to the target, overwhelming its resources.
- **Tools:** LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon), HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon), botnets.

**Mitigation:** 
- **Rate Limiting:** Restricting the number of requests a user can make.
- **Increasing Bandwidth:** Ensuring the network can handle large volumes of traffic.
- **Firewalls and DDoS Protection Services:** Using tools like Cloudflare to filter malicious traffic.

### Identifying and Mitigating Viruses

**Identification:** Signs include unusual system behavior, slow performance, frequent crashes, unexpected pop-ups, and unknown programs starting automatically.

**Spread:** Via email attachments, malicious downloads, infected USB drives, and network connections.

**Mitigation:**
- **Antivirus Software:** Regularly updated antivirus programs can detect and remove malware.
- **Employee Education:** Training staff to recognize suspicious emails and websites.
- **Network Security:** Implementing firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and regular patching of software to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.
