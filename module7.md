### Module 7: Malware Threats

#### 7.1 Introduction to Malware
- **Malware**: Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computer systems.
- **Types**: Viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, rootkits, and more.

#### 7.2 Types of Malware
1. **Virus**
   - Attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when these files are executed.
   - Types: File infector, macro virus, boot sector virus, polymorphic virus.
2. **Worm**
   - Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without human intervention.
   - Notable Examples: ILOVEYOU, Conficker.
3. **Trojan**
   - Disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into installing it.
   - Types: Remote Access Trojan (RAT), banking Trojan, downloader Trojan.
4. **Ransomware**
   - Encrypts files on the victim’s system and demands payment for decryption keys.
   - Notable Examples: WannaCry, Cryptolocker.
5. **Spyware**
   - Collects information about users without their knowledge.
   - Types: Keyloggers, screen scrapers, adware.
6. **Adware**
   - Displays unwanted advertisements on the victim’s system.
   - Can be bundled with legitimate software.
7. **Rootkit**
   - Hides itself and other malicious software from detection.
   - Types: User-mode rootkit, kernel-mode rootkit, bootkit.
8. **Botnet**
   - Network of compromised systems (bots) controlled by an attacker (botmaster).
   - Used for DDoS attacks, spamming, and other malicious activities.

#### 7.3 Malware Lifecycle
1. **Delivery**
   - How malware is delivered to the target system.
   - Methods: Email attachments, malicious websites, drive-by downloads, infected USB drives.
2. **Infection**
   - How malware installs itself on the target system.
   - Techniques: Exploiting vulnerabilities, social engineering, bundling with legitimate software.
3. **Concealment**
   - How malware hides its presence to avoid detection.
   - Techniques: Obfuscation, encryption, using rootkits.
4. **Payload Execution**
   - The actions malware performs once activated.
   - Activities: Data theft, system damage, financial fraud, espionage.
5. **Propagation**
   - How malware spreads to other systems.
   - Methods: Network propagation, removable media, email spam.

#### 7.4 Malware Analysis
1. **Static Analysis**
   - Examining malware without executing it.
   - Techniques: Analyzing code, checking file properties, using antivirus scanners.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Executing malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior.
   - Tools: Cuckoo Sandbox, REMnux, Process Monitor.
3. **Code Analysis**
   - Reviewing malware’s source code or disassembled code to understand its functionality.
   - Tools: IDA Pro, Ghidra, OllyDbg.

#### 7.5 Malware Detection Techniques
1. **Signature-Based Detection**
   - Identifying malware based on known patterns (signatures).
   - Tools: Antivirus software, IDS/IPS.
2. **Heuristic-Based Detection**
   - Identifying malware based on suspicious behavior or characteristics.
   - Techniques: Anomaly detection, behavioral analysis.
3. **Behavioral-Based Detection**
   - Monitoring system behavior to detect malware activity.
   - Tools: Behavior monitoring software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.
4. **Sandboxing**
   - Executing suspicious files in an isolated environment to observe their behavior.
   - Tools: Cuckoo Sandbox, FireEye.

#### 7.6 Countermeasures for Malware
1. **Antivirus and Antimalware Software**
   - Installing and regularly updating antivirus solutions to detect and remove malware.
2. **Regular Software Updates**
   - Keeping operating systems and applications up to date with the latest security patches.
3. **User Education**
   - Training users to recognize phishing attempts, avoid downloading suspicious files, and practice safe browsing.
4. **Network Segmentation**
   - Dividing the network into segments to limit the spread of malware.
5. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Regularly backing up important data and maintaining a robust recovery plan.
6. **Endpoint Protection**
   - Using EDR systems to detect and respond to threats on endpoints.
7. **Email Security**
   - Implementing email filtering solutions to block malicious attachments and links.

#### 7.7 Reporting Malware Incidents
- **Incident Documentation**: Recording all relevant details about the malware incident.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluating the extent of the damage caused by the malware.
- **Containment and Eradication**: Steps taken to contain the malware and remove it from affected systems.
- **Recovery and Mitigation**: Actions taken to recover from the incident and prevent future occurrences.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Reviewing the incident to improve defenses and response strategies.
